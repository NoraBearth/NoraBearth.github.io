<p align="justify">I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of St. Gallen and working as a research assistant at the chair of Michael Lechner. 
	My research interests focus on causal machine learning and applied econometrics in the field of labor and health economics. In my spare time, I like to
do sports, such as climbing, skiing or hiking, and reading. </p>
